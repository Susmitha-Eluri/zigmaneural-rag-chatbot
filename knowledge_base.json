    "content": "Title: NovaSoft AWS Usage and Spending Policy \n1. Purpose \n\u2022 This policy defines how NovaSoft teams use AWS accounts and budgets. \n\u2022 The goal is to control cloud costs while allowing teams to experiment. \n2. Account types \n\u2022 There are three types of AWS accounts at NovaSoft: Development, Staging, and Production. \n\u2022 Only the Cloud Platform team can create new AWS accounts. \n\u2022 Each product team is assigned specific accounts for their services. \n3. Spending limits \n\u2022 Development accounts have a spending limit of 500 USD per month. \n\u2022 Staging accounts have a spending limit of 1,000 USD per month. \n\u2022 Production accounts are monitored daily; any unexpected spike above 20% of the average \nmonthly bill must be investigated within 24 hours. \n4. Who can create resources \n\u2022 Only engineers with the \u201cDevOps\u201d or \u201cCloud Admin\u201d role can create or delete AWS resources \nsuch as EC2 instances and RDS databases. \n\u2022 Application developers should use predefined templates and Terraform modules when \npossible. \n5. Tagging requirements \n\u2022 All resources must include the following tags: \n\u2022 Project \u2013 project or product name. \n\u2022 Environment \u2013 Dev, Staging, or Prod. \n\u2022 Owner \u2013 team or squad name. \n\u2022 Untagged resources may be shut down after a notification. \n6. Cost monitoring \n\u2022 The Finance team receives a weekly AWS cost report. \n\u2022 If any account crosses 80% of its monthly budget, a Slack alert is sent to the owning team. \n\u2022 Teams must review their usage and shut down unused resources. \n7. Data security \n\u2022 Production databases must have automated backups enabled with at least 7 days of \nretention. \n\u2022 Access keys should not be hard-coded in source code; use environment variables or secret \nmanagers.\n8. Environments and data classification \n\u2022 Development and staging accounts must not contain real customer data. \n\u2022 Only anonymized or fake test data may be used in non-production environments. \n\u2022 Production environments are classified as Highly Sensitive and follow stricter access rules. \n9. Access management \n\u2022 All AWS access must go through the company\u2019s single sign-on system where available. \n\u2022 Individual IAM users should be avoided; IAM roles and temporary credentials are preferred. \n\u2022 Access reviews must be conducted at least once every quarter to ensure only required \npermissions are active. \n10. Backup and recovery \n\u2022 Critical production databases must have automatic daily backups with at least 7 days of \nretention. \n\u2022 Backups should be stored in a different availability zone or region where possible. \n\u2022 Disaster recovery drills should be performed at least once a year to validate restoration \nprocedures. \n11. Logging and monitoring \n\u2022 CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and other logging tools must be enabled for production accounts. \n\u2022 Logs should be retained for at least 90 days for security investigations. \n\u2022 Alerts for unusual activities, such as many failed logins or sudden spikes in API calls, should \nbe configured. \n12. Use of experimental services \n\u2022 New or experimental AWS services should first be tried in a sandbox account. \n\u2022 Before using them in production, the team must review security, cost, and support \nimplications. \n\u2022 Any service that stores customer data must be reviewed by the security team. \n13. Data transfer and egress costs \n\u2022 Large data transfers out of AWS can generate high egress costs. \n\u2022 Teams should plan architecture to minimize unnecessary data transfer between regions. \n\u2022 Bulk downloads of logs or backups should be scheduled during off-peak hours if possible. \n14. Third-party tools in AWS \n\u2022 Any third-party tool that connects to AWS accounts must be reviewed by security and \napproved by the Cloud Platform team. \n\u2022 API keys and tokens for such tools must be stored securely and rotated regularly.\n15. Violations and corrective actions \n\u2022 If a team exceeds the defined spending limit repeatedly, a cost review meeting will be \nscheduled. \n\u2022 Unsafe configurations, such as publicly exposed databases, must be fixed immediately. \n\u2022 Serious or repeated violations of this policy may be escalated to senior management."
